    <p>
  There are many benefits of using a version control system for your projects. It helps to collaborate with colleagues on projects. Also, it makes it easier  to reverse any of the contribution you or your colleague made. Think about this, no more hours of debugging, just small command which will reverse recent commit and you can keep contributing to the project without hours of troubleshooting.
     Version Control also makes your work organized. You know why and when you created a file. You can observe your progress.

        Git helps keep track of changes. For example, you can commit small parts of code with a comments explaining the functionality of the component. Also, when typing 'git log' you are able to see all the logs ( changes ) in your project.

        GitHub is one of the most popular repositories for code storing. It enables you to see all the addition ( in green) and deletion ( in red) you made in nice, visual way. Also, you are able to see comments of every commit and the date when commits were created. GitHub also makes it easier to collaborate with your colleagues. You can push to the same file in the same time. When error occurs, you just simply pick better version of code.     </p>
