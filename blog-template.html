	<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
	Designing with a pair is awsome ! You can share your concepts what do you think is easier to find & read and what users will like more.
	Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
	Definitelly. It makes your mind more organized. And also, development goes very smooth while wireframing.
	What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
	We decided to not use css, also to create very simple layout by precising what is the blog role.  
	What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ? 
	I learnt about section part and my pair learnt about main. Also I learnt about meta tag which tells us that we use the most common in the world letter characters-->
